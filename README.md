# currency-classifier-using-deep-learning
This project uses deep learning to classify different types of currency. The project is implemented using Tensorflow, Numpy, Glob, Pandas and Sequential libraries.

Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following libraries installed:

Tensorflow
Numpy
Glob
Pandas
Keras

#Data
The data used in this project consists of images of different types of currency. The data is stored in a directory and can be accessed using the Glob library. The data is then preprocessed using Pandas and Numpy to convert it into a format suitable for training a deep learning model.

#Model
The model used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is implemented using the Sequential API of the Keras library. The model is trained on the preprocessed data and can then be used to classify new images of currency.

#Usage
To use this classifier, you can use the predict method of the trained model and pass in a path to an image of currency. The model will then return the predicted class of the currency in the image.

#Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of deep learning to classify different types of currency. The project uses Tensorflow, Numpy, Glob, Pandas and Sequential libraries to implement the deep learning model. The model can be used to classify new images of currency.
